      <h2>Lift Off</h2>

      <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in <br>
        size. Finally it shrank to the size of a
        marble, the most beautiful <br>
        you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so <br>
        fragile, so delicate,
        that if you touched it with a finger it would <br>
        fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

      <h3>Can We Visit Planets?</h3>

      <p>Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of <br>
        the world as one: a single sphere, a globe,
        having the qualities of <br>
        a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually <br>
        meet.</p>

      <p>Which there is no center because every point, or none, is center â€” an equal earth which all men occupy as
        equals. The airman's earth, if free men make it.</p>

        <h3>Let's Go For A Walk</h3>

        <p class="wlk-blurb-1">The Earth was small, light blue, and so touchingly alone, our <br>
          home that must be defended like a holy relic.
          The Earth was <br>
          absolutely round.</p>

        <p class="wlk-blurb-2">Suddenly struck me that that tiny pea, pretty and blue, was the <br>
          Earth. I put up my thumb and shut one eye,
          and my thumb <br>
          blotted out the planet Earth.</p>
